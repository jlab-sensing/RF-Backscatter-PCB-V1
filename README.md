# WaDAR Tag V1

This repo consists of the backscatter tag PCBs used with the WaDAR sensing system. This repo is a submodule of [WaDAR](https://github.com/jlab-sensing/wadar). This is our first version of the tag used in WaDAR's sensing system.

## Versions Overview

Each version is archived upon PCB fabrication and assembly, ensuring traceability and reproducibility of hardware iterations.

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_0
- **Status**: Archived (Non-functional)
- **Description**: Initial prototype of backscatter tag PCB. Board is included for historical refernce; does not support functional operation.
- **Authors**: Josie Dominguez, jocadomi@ucsc.edu

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_1
- **Description**: First operational version of the backscatter tag. Oscillates at a fixed frequency of 2^n Hz, where n is determined by the selected oscillator. 
- **Authors**: Eric Vetha, evetha@ucsc.edu | Jack Lin, jlin143@ucsc.edu

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_2 
- **Description**: Enhanced version featuring an oscillator supporting a more flexible frequency range.
- **Authors**: Eric Vetha, evetha@ucsc.edu
