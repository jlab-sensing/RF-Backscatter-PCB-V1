# WaDAR Tag

This repo consists of the backscatter tag PCBs used with the WaDAR sensing system.

TODO: Description of PCB purpose and function.

## Versions Overview

Each version is archived upon PCB fabrication and assembly.

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_0
- **Description**: First iteration of the board. Board does not function. Included in repo just to archive it.
- **Authors**: Josie Dominguez, jocadomi@ucsc.edu
- **Components**: TODO

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_1
- **Description**: First working iteration. Oscillates at a set frequency at 2^n, where n is determined by the oscillator of chocie.
- **Authors**: Eric Vetha, evetha@ucsc.edu | Jack Lin, jlin143@ucsc.edu
- **Components**: TODO

### WaDAR_Tag_V1_2 (Not yet fabricated)
- **Description**: Upgrade to board to incorporate an oscillator programmable at more flexibile frequencies.
- **Authors**: Eric Vetha, evetha@ucsc.edu
- **Components**: TODO
